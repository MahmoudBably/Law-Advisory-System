						&ldquo;We were very impressed with L'Avocat Law Firm. They prepared a complete set of terms and conditions for our business and a privacy policy - protecting us in areas we were unaware we needed protection in! They are fast, friendly, inquisitive, easy to talk to, extremely thorough and very fairly priced. We will continue to use them as our business expands.&ldquo; <span>- David Askew</span>
